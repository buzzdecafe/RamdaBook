- Prefatory materials

    - Inspiration and history
    - Rationale, including "Why not `lodash`/`Underscore`?"
    - Aim toward JS programmers, not FP experts
    - How FP fits in JS
    - Community
    - Standard tech book artifacts
    - How to read (e.g. skip Ch 2, but make sure you understand Ch 3, or whatever)
    - Typesetting conventions

- Basic usage
  - Simple example (`map`?), showing
    - Parameter ordering
    - Auto-currying
    - Immutability
    - Declarative over imperative
  - Composition
    - Thinking in pipelines
    - `pipe`, `compose`, `o` (?)
    - `converge`, `lift`
  - Common FP functions
    - `map`, `filter`, `find`, `reduce`

- Philosophy
  - Simplicity
  - Referential transparency
  - Immutability
  - Practical, not academic
  - Library, not framework

- Working with Objects
  - Using properties

  - Combining objects
    - `merge*`
  - Comparing objects
    - `equals`, `has`, `where`
  - Creating objects
    - `clone`, `evolve`, `applySpec`
  - Restructuring objects
